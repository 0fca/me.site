# Pika Cloud Console
Pika Cloud Console is an application which is more of my own portfolio than the cloud's subsystem.
It is supposed to look similar to DOS 7.6 of Centurion minicomputer - in a way how the commands look and behave.
Application reminds Look and Feel of mentioned OS or at least it is supposed to bring it back.
The app is not responsive and is not supposed to be used on mobile devices. Actually, it won't work on those as it does not use any kind of textarea or input field so the mobile OS does not know that it should show the keyboard.

## Commands

Well, actually, the whole thing is to guess what is what.
The only hint is: start with typing "S1". It is just like choosing a drive on a real machine when it prompts user with: D=.
After entering the main Cloud Console screen - try whatever you see fit, maybe you will guess some commands and/or parameters.
